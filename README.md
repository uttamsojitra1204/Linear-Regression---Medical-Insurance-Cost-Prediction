# Linear-Regression---Medical-Insurance-Cost-Prediction ðŸ§®

=> Project Workflow

1. Data Collection: Importing and loading the dataset.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing distributions and relationships among data.
3. Preprocessing: Label encoding categorical variables and splitting the data into train and test sets.
4. Label encoding categorical columns
5. Splitting Data: Dividing data into training and testing sets.
6.mModel Training: Using Linear Regression to fit the data.
7. Model Evaluation: Calculating RÂ² Score for train and test sets.
8. Prediction: Making predictions using sample input data.

=> Usage
- After installation, you can open the project in a Jupyter notebook or your preferred Python environment.
- Train the linear regression model on the training data.
- Evaluate the model on the test data to ensure good performance.

=> Conclusion
This project successfully developed a linear regression model to predict health insurance charges based on factors such as age, gender, BMI, smoking habits, number of children, and region. Achieving an RÂ² score of approximately 75%, the model demonstrates a solid level of predictive accuracy, providing valuable insights for insurance companies in estimating premiums and helping individuals understand the financial implications of their lifestyle choices. Future enhancements could involve exploring more advanced algorithms or optimizing features for improved accuracy.
